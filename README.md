## **CS354 Minor Project**
### **Machine Unlearning**

### **Project Overview**

The project involves a series of experiments and data analysis conducted to understand the process of unlearning in machine learning models. It aims to investigate how models can effectively discard previously learned information, especially in scenarios where it becomes necessary to adapt to new data or correct biases.

### **Contents**
This repository contains the following files:

1. `data-analysis-cifar-10.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing data analysis related to the CIFAR-10 dataset.
2. `exp1-machine-unlearning.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for the first experiment on machine unlearning.
3. `exp2-machine-unlearning.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook for the second experiment on machine unlearning.
4. `Machine-Unlearning Project Report.pdf`: Detailed report documenting the project methodology, findings, and conclusions.
5. `Machine_Unlearning_Notion_Metric.pdf`: PDF file providing reference metrics and guidelines used in the project.
6. `Machine Unlearning Presentation.pdf`: PDF of the Presentation for the Project.
